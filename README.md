# SortingMethods
Learned and implemented sorting algorthims such as collection, selection, bubble, insertion, merge, quick, and bucket sort.

Selection sort:
- iterative comparison
- loop until the condition is satisfied

Bubble sort:
- iterative comparison, compariong data-set from one end to other
- compares adjacent pairs of elements
- loop until one traversal step is finished and repeats array length times

Insertion sort:
- iterastive sorting method, repeats until no input elements remain
- removes one element from the array list and finds the best location to insert it

Merge sort:
- divide and conquer
- divides array into two arrays and compare
- when array list is sorted, merge sorted arrays together
- common way is using resurive divide and conquer method

Quick sort:
- uses pointers, numbers used to compare and sort
- left pointer used to scan rightward of arraylist
- right pointer used to scan leftward of arraylist

Bucket sort:
- method is not generic because it is restricted for specific data
- avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets
- treats elements as if they were strings of the same length
- group elements by a specific digit or character oof a string
- placed into buckets based on the matching key

Used generic and comparable for sorting methods.
Used System.arraycopy() method to copy the content of initial array with pre-set size.
Compared the execution time of an Integer type dataset.
